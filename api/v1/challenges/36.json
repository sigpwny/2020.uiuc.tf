Now, normally, I keep my friend code very secret, so I'm not worried, but recently I noticed some suspicious traffic on my computer. \r\n\r\nDid he actually try to hack me??? I managed to grab a memory dump of this strange process along with a document on the desktop of his laptop while he was in the bathroom. Can you find out if he got my friend code? Oh no, I better put my lovely Dorado in the museum!\r\n\r\nAuthor: DrDinosaur", "category": "Forensics", "state": "visible", "max_attempts": 0, "type": "standard", "type_data": {"id": "standard", "name": "standard", "templates": {"create": "/plugins/challenges/assets/create.html", "update": "/plugins/challenges/assets/update.html", "view": "/plugins/challenges/assets/view.html"}, "scripts": {"create": "/plugins/challenges/assets/create.js", "update": "/plugins/challenges/assets/update.js", "view": "/plugins/challenges/assets/view.js"}}, "solves": 1, "files": ["/files/f3ce3e897c92da5a96594a3594738a2dd39a6106f79c5c28ff2eb1a2/traffic.pcapng", "/files/f3ce3e897c92da5a96594a3594738a2dd39a6106f79c5c28ff2eb1a2/memory_dump", "/files/9e7531293c5bfdf44816224847af976e/notes.txt"], "tags": [], "hints": []}}
